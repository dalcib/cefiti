# Product Guide

## Vision
The **Catálogo de Exigências Fitossanitárias para o Trânsito Interestadual (CEFiTI)** is a strategic digital tool for Brazil's agricultural defense. It acts as the integration nexus between federal legislation and field logistics, ensuring sanitary security at internal borders. By consolidating complex phytosanitary regulations into an accessible, searchable catalog, CEFiTI mitigates the risk of spreading quarantine pests, protecting national agricultural assets and maintaining Brazil's status as a reliable exporter.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Risk Management:** Translates complex legal norms (INs, Portarias) into clear operational guidelines for producers and auditors.
- **Traceability & Compliance:** Supports the issuance of essential documents like the Permissão de Trânsito de Vegetais (PTV) and Certificado Fitossanitário de Origem (CFO), creating an auditable trail.
- **Agility:** Provides instant access to updated regulatory status, crucial for perishable goods logistics.

## Target Users
The system serves a diverse ecosystem of stakeholders:
- **Agricultural Auditors (Fiscais Agropecuários):** Federal and State agents who verify compliance at transit barriers and authorize shipments.
- **Responsible Technical Engineers (RTs - Agronomists/Foresters):** Professionals who certify production units (UP) and consolidation units (UC), using the system to determine necessary inspections and laboratory tests.
- **Producers & Traders:** Stakeholders who need to plan shipment viability and ensure documentation (e.g., Invoice, PTV) is correct before transport.
- **Logistics Operators:** Transporters who need to verify transit prohibitions or requirements for specific routes.

## Key Features
- **Phytosanitary Search Engine:** Allows querying requirements by:
    - **Scientific Name:** Precise lookup to avoid ambiguity.
    - **Origin (UF):** The state where the product was grown or consolidated.
    - **Destination (UF):** The state where the product is going.
    - **Product Part:** Specific parts (fruit, seedling, seed, wood) which may have different regulations.
- **Regulatory Interpretation:** Displays results as:
    - **No Requirements:** Free transit.
    - **Prohibited Transit:** Movement is banned due to pest risk.
    - **Conditioned Transit:** Requires specific documents (PTV, CFO) or treatments (e.g., "Partida lacrada", "Tratamento com fungicida").
- **Legislative Repository:** Direct links to the full text of relevant Normative Instructions and Ordinances.
- **Offline Capability:** A PWA architecture ensuring functionality in remote areas with limited connectivity.

## Strategic Context
CEFiTI operates within the **Sistema Unificado de Atenção à Sanidade Agropecuária (SUASA)**. It is dynamic, updating immediately in response to new pest outbreaks (e.g., changes in *Bactrocera carambolae* status). It harmonizes state-level regulations with federal directives, preventing trade barriers while ensuring biological safety.

# Product Guidelines

## Prose and Messaging
- **Tone:** Formal and Regulatory.
- **Style:** Precise language following legal and governmental standards. Prioritize official terminology to ensure compliance and authoritative accuracy.
- **Clarity:** While formal, the output must be actionable. Complex legal text should be presented alongside clear operational directives (e.g., "Transit Prohibited").

## Terminology & Glossary
Strict adherence to the official glossary is mandatory to maintain legal validity.
- **UP (Unidade de Produção):** The farm or orchard of origin.
- **UC (Unidade de Consolidação):** Packing houses or processing units.
- **PTV (Permissão de Trânsito de Vegetais):** The transit document issued by state authorities.
- **CFO/CFOC:** Certificates of Origin issued by Responsible Technicians (RTs).
- **Praga Quarentenária:** A pest of potential economic importance, either absent (A1) or present under official control (A2).
- **Partida (Consignment):** The specific quantity of plants being moved. Use "Partida" instead of generic terms like "Carga" when referring to the certified unit.

## Visual Identity
- **Brand Standards:** Strict adherence to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAPA) branding, including official logos, designated color palettes, and standard typography.
- **Consistency:** Ensure all UI elements align with the visual identity used in other official agricultural tools.

## Usability and Accessibility
- **Offline First:** Provide clear visual feedback regarding data synchronization. The user must always know if they are working with cached data and when the last update occurred.
- **Connectivity Awareness:** Ensure the interface remains functional and responsive even in areas with poor or no internet connectivity.
- **Field-Ready:** High contrast and touch-friendly targets for use on mobile devices in outdoor environments (barriers, farms).

## Communication and Updates
- **Transparency:** Prominent display of the current database version and its effective date.
- **Traceability:** Users should be able to easily verify that they are using the most current set of regulations.

## Regulatory Context
- **Clarity:** Provide simplified, plain-language summaries alongside formal legal text to help users interpret complex regulatory exceptions quickly without losing the necessary legal rigor.
